    <p>Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
        Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
        Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
        Girl who has everything?
        Look at this trove, treasures untold
        How many wonders can data-one cavern hold?
        Looking around here you'd think
        Sure, she's got everything
        I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty  
        I've got whozits and whatzits galore  
        I've got twenty
        But who cares?
        No big deal
        I want more
        I wanna be where the people are
        I wanna see, wanna see them dancing
        Walking around data-on those
        What do you call 'em?
        Oh, feet
        Flipping your fins you don't get too far
        Legs are r
        Strolling along down a-
        What's that word again?
        Street!
        Up where they walk, up where they run
        Up where they stay all day in the sun
        Wandering free
        Wish I could be part of that world
        What would I give if I could live
        Out of these waters?
        What would I pay to spend a day
        Warm data-on the sand?
        Betcha' data-on land, they understand
        Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
        Bright young women, sick of swimming
        Ready to stand
        I'm ready to know what the people know
        Ask 'em my questions
        And get some answers
        What's a fire and why does it-
        What's the word?
        Burn?
        When's it my turn?
        Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above
        Out of the sea
        Wish I could be
        Part of that wor</p>
